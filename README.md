# SIC-XE-Assembler

### Implementation
The project's goal is to develop a two-pass SIC/XE assembler, consisting of Passes 1 and 2. The Assembler I  created supports all four formats — 1, 2, 3, 4 — as well as programme relocation and all SIC/XE instructions. The following machine-independent functionalities are also supported:
  1. Literals
  2. Symbol Defining Statements
  3. Expressions
  4. Program Blocks

Assembler source code utilising the SIC/XE instruction set is used as input. The following files will be produced by Assembler as output:
  1. A Symbol Table will be produced by Pass 1 alone.
  2. The Intermediate File for the Pass 2 will likewise be generated by Pass 1.
  3. Pass 2 will produce a listing file including each instruction's object code, block number, and input assembly code address.
  4. Pass 2 will also produce an object program that includes the H, D, R, T, M, and E types of records.
  5. A file containing the assembly program's errors is also created (if any).
  6. A file is also created that has a symbol table, literal table, and tables for external definition and external reference.

### How to execute?
Run command `g++ pass2.cpp -o ex` in the VSCode Terminal which generates a executable file ex.exe. Execute this file using the command `./ex`. After doing this, you will be asked to type the name of the input file. Type the name of the input file and press enter. A bunch of text files will be generated denoting the output of the SIC-XE program.
